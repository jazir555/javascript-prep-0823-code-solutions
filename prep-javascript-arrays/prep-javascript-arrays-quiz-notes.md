## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?

Arrays can hold many values(as well as different data types) under a single name, which can be individually called by the index number of the object.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.

You declare a variable using the const assignment operator to an array object. An array is created in between two brackets([]) and the values are comma separated.

- What number represents the **first** index of an array?

0

- How can you access the last element of an array?

Declare a new variable with the value of a previously created object, calling a property of that object subtracting 1, close the bracket and end with a semi-colon.
